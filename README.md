## Overall Description
Our project revolves around a two-button game that mirrors my passion for fighting games and competitive spirit. Drawing inspiration from my love for fighting games and the thrill of competitive games, we designed a game based on the traditional "Rock, Paper, Scissors" concept but with a creative twist that reflects my interests.

The game includes three main actions: Attack, Parry, and Block, each corresponding to familiar fighting game moves. These interactions go beyond the standard RPS format, incorporating fighting game strategy, where each move  counters another. This variation adds depth and strategy, capturing the excitement of fast-paced decisions in competitive gameplay. The game's inspiration comes from iconic Street fighter 3, adding nostalgic elements that speak to my fondness for the Street Fighter series.

With two simple buttons, players can make decisions that impact the battle between two on-screen characters. The design intentionally reflects the classic arcade era, featuring a sleek yet nostalgic aesthetic to make the experience both engaging and visually captivating. The simplicity of the controls, paired with the rich visual and strategic depth, creates a game that's both fun and challenging, embodying the spirit of the competitive gaming I love.
